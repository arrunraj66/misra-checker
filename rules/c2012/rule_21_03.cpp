/*
 * MISRA C:2012 Rule 21.3 - engineering scaffold
 *
 * Topic: Standard library usage
 * Engineering intent: Independent checker contract for Rule 21.3 in the Standard library usage family. The exact normative predicate remains linked to the controlled licensed rule specification.
 * Analysis expansion: Match headers, reserved identifiers, declarations, and calls against the configured controlled-library policy.
 * Normative notice: Wording, amplification, exceptions, and examples remain in
 * the licensed MISRA specification and require independent approval.
 * Implementation status: Scaffold only; no compliance decision is made.
